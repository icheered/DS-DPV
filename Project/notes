How has the average class size changed over the years (2013-2016)?

1. Filter the activities to remove any activity with a size of 0
2. Filter the Activities dataset by year.
3. Calculate the total number of students in each year by summing the "size" column.
4. Calculate the total number of classes in each year by counting the number of activities.
5. Divide the total number of students by the total number of classes for each year to get the average class size.
